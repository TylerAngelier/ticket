# ticket

The git-backed issue tracker for AI agents. Rooted in the Unix Philosophy, `tk` is inspired by Joe Armstrong's [Minimal Viable Program](https://joearms.github.io/published/2014-06-25-minimal-viable-program.html) with additional quality of life features for managing and querying against complex issue dependency graphs.

`tk` was written as a full replacement for [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads). It shares many similar commands but without the need for keeping a SQLite file in sync or a rogue background daemon mangling your changes. It ships with a `migrate-beads` command to make this a smooth transition.

Tickets are markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `.tickets/`. This allows AI agents to easily search them for relevant content without dumping ten thousand character JSONL lines into their context window.

Using ticket IDs as file names also allows IDEs to quickly navigate to the ticket for you. For example, you might run `git log` in your terminal and see something like:

```
nw-5c46: add SSE connection management 
```

VS Code allows you to Ctrl+Click or Cmd+Click the ID and jump directly to the file to read the details.

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
brew install tylerangelier/tap/ticket        # everything (tk + plugins)
brew install tylerangelier/tap/ticket-core   # just the tk script
```

**From source (auto-updates on git pull):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TylerAngelier/ticket.git
cd ticket && ln -s "$PWD/ticket" ~/.local/bin/tk
```

**Or** just copy `ticket` to somewhere in your PATH.

## Requirements

`tk` is a portable bash script requiring only coreutils, so it works out of the box on any POSIX system with bash installed. The `query` command requires `jq`. Uses `rg` (ripgrep) if available, falls back to `grep`.

## Agent Setup

Add this line to your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`:

```
This project uses a CLI ticket system for task management. Run `tk help` when you need to use it.
```

Claude Opus picks it up naturally from there. Other models may need additional guidance.

## Usage

```bash
tk - minimal ticket system with dependency tracking

Usage: tk <command> [args]

Commands:
  create [title] [options] Create ticket, prints ID
    -d, --description      Description text
    --design               Design notes
    --acceptance           Acceptance criteria
    -t, --type             Type (bug|feature|task|epic|chore) [default: task]
    -p, --priority         Priority 0-4, 0=highest [default: 2]
    -a, --assignee         Assignee [default: git user.name]
    --external-ref         External reference (e.g., gh-123, JIRA-456)
    --parent               Parent ticket ID
    --tags                 Comma-separated tags (e.g., --tags ui,backend,urgent)
  start <id>               Set status to in_progress
  close <id>               Set status to closed
  reopen <id>              Set status to open
  status <id> <status>     Update status (open|in_progress|closed)
  dep <id> <dep-id>        Add dependency (id depends on dep-id)
  dep tree [--full] <id>   Show dependency tree (--full disables dedup)
  dep cycle                Find dependency cycles in open tickets
  undep <id> <dep-id>      Remove dependency
  link <id> <id> [id...]   Link tickets together (symmetric)
  unlink <id> <target-id>  Remove link between tickets
  ls|list [--status=X] [-a X] [-T X] [--flat]
                           List tickets as a hierarchy tree (see below)
  ready [-a X] [-T X]      List open/in-progress tickets with deps resolved
  blocked [-a X] [-T X]    List open/in-progress tickets with unresolved deps
  closed [--limit=N] [-a X] [-T X] List recently closed tickets (default 20, by mtime)
  show <id>                Display ticket
  add-note <id> [text]     Append timestamped note (or pipe via stdin)
  super <cmd> [args]       Bypass plugins, run built-in command directly

Bundled plugins (ticket-extras):
  edit <id>                Open ticket in $EDITOR
  ls|list [--status=X] [-a X] [-T X]   List tickets
  query [jq-filter]        Output tickets as JSON, optionally filtered (requires jq)
  migrate-beads            Import tickets from .beads/issues.jsonl (requires jq)

Searches parent directories for .tickets/ (override with TICKETS_DIR env var)
Supports partial ID matching (e.g., 'tk show 5c4' matches 'nw-5c46')
```

### Hierarchical list view

`ls`/`list` renders tickets as a tree. A ticket's dependencies are its
children: an epic depends on its stories, a story on its tasks.

```
epi-a1b2 [P1][open] Ship the thing
├── sto-c3d4 [P2][open] Story A
│   ┆ deps: tsk-9999 ⛔        <- cross-dependency, still open
├── sto-e5f6 [P2][in_progress] Story B
│   ┆ deps: gho-1111 (missing) <- references a deleted ticket
└── ▸ sto-7777 [P2][closed] Done story · 3 closed   <- collapsed subtree
```

- Fully-closed subtrees collapse to one line (`▸`, dimmed when colors are on)
- With `-a`/`-T`/`--status` filters, non-matching ancestors appear as
  `(context)` so children stay in place
- Dependency cycles render inline with `⟲` and warn on stderr
- `--flat` prints one `id [Pn][status] title` line per ticket for scripts
```

## Plugins

Executables named `tk-<cmd>` or `ticket-<cmd>` in your PATH are invoked automatically. This allows you to add custom commands or override built-in ones.

```bash
# Create a simple plugin
cat > ~/.local/bin/tk-hello <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# tk-plugin: Say hello
echo "Hello from plugin!"
EOF
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/tk-hello

# Now it's available
tk hello        # runs tk-hello
tk help         # lists it under "Plugins"
```

**Plugin descriptions** (shown in `tk help`):
- Scripts: comment `# tk-plugin: description` in first 10 lines
- Binaries: `--tk-describe` flag outputs `tk-plugin: description`

**Plugin environment variables:**
- `TICKETS_DIR` - path to the .tickets directory (may be empty)
- `TK_SCRIPT` - absolute path to the tk script

**Calling built-ins from plugins:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tk-plugin: Custom create with extras
id=$("$TK_SCRIPT" super create "$@")
echo "Created $id, doing extra stuff..."
```

Use `tk super <cmd>` to bypass plugins and run the built-in directly.

The `list`/`ls`, `ready`, and `blocked` commands are backed by a compiled Go
binary (`cmd/ticket-ls`) installed as `ticket-ls`, `ticket-list`,
`ticket-ready`, and `ticket-blocked`. Build and install with:

```sh
make install    # builds and symlinks into ~/.local/bin
```

## Testing

Tests have two layers:

- **Unit tests** (`go test ./...`): parser, graph, and golden-file renderer tests
- **BDD tests** ([behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)): end-to-end
  scenarios shelling out to the real CLI

If you have `uv` [installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) simply:

```sh
make test          # build + unit + behave
make differential  # byte-compare Go plugin vs bash built-ins on random fixtures
make bench         # performance regression gate (5k tickets, 2s budget)
```

## Migrating from Beads

```bash
tk migrate-beads

# review new files if you like
git status

# check state matches expectations
tk ready
tk blocked

# compare against
bd ready
bd blocked

# all good, let's go
git rm -rf .beads
git add .tickets
git commit -am "ditch beads"
```
